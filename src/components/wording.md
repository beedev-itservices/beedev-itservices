BeeDev Services is a Veteran owned small business, with the idea of helping other small businesses.

We take the hive mentality personally.  Just because we have the skills to build a website or set up a network doesn't mean you don't have ideas on what you want.  We welcome - in fact we insist that you are part of the process.

Develop - No 2 hives are alike, and the same goes for businesses.  Let us build a hive that is unique to your business needs.  Together we will create smooth unique websites that meet your companies needs.  From Customer facing websites showing off what you have to offer the world to internal websites that allow you and your employees to focus on their jobs and have the information they need in 1 central location we can take the stress of getting it done of your shoulders

Maintain - Keeping your site up to date doesn't have to be something you need to worry about.  We are here to help with that.  We offer several ways to help you.  We excel at making sure that your websites are running their best.  Just need a few changes to your site?  We got your back there to we have packages to check in from a monthly basis on up to yearly.  

Repair - Something not working?  Not to worry our worker bees are here to help.  We can get you back up and running.

At BeeDev Services we pride ourselves in honesty.  If we recommend getting a new system it's not that we can't fix it (although that can sometimes happen), it's because we feel that the cost of us fixing it would be more than getting a new one.  

That doesn't mean that we will just say sorry you need a new computer and send you on your way, we will recommend what type you should get, from where we would recommend, and we can even help you get it up and running again.  

We take the hive mentality personally.  Just because we have the skills to build a website or set up a network doesn't mean you don't have ideas on what you want.  We welcome - in fact we insist that you are part of the process.  

Our focus may be on small businesses and entrepreneurs but that doesn't mean we don't have something for everyone.
